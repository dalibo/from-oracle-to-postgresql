Each temporary table is private to its own session. Data inserted into a temporary table can be automatically destroyed at the transaction end (using ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS clause) or only at the end of the session (with default implicit clause ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS).</description></item><item><title>Triggers conversion</title><link>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/triggers-conversion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/triggers-conversion/</guid><description>Triggers conversion # Structure of a trigger # In Oracle, a trigger declaration embeds the triggers code.

Sequences are very similar in PostgreSQL and Oracle. A few points need attention, though.
On a general basis, clauses preceded by NO to use default values need a space between NO and the rest of the clause to be ported to PostgreSQL.</description></item><item><title>Cursors</title><link>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/cursors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/cursors/</guid><description>Cursors # The cursors variable&amp;rsquo;s notation is different in Oracle and PostgreSQL.

There are two major differences. First, Oracle implicitely starts a new transaction when a statement is run and keeps it running until COMMIT, while PostgreSQL is using autocommit by default.</description></item><item><title>Partitioning</title><link>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/partitioning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/partitioning/</guid><description>Partitioning # PostgreSQL accepts declarative partitioning since version 10 and things keep getting better from major release to another. A table is devided into partitions as declared by its partitioned key, which is decisive when defining the model and could be costly to change during the life of the data.</description></item><item><title>PL/SQL specificities</title><link>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/pl-sql-specificities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/pl-sql-specificities/</guid><description>PL/SQL specificities # Autonomous transactions # We often find PRAGMA associated with autonomous transactions in PL/SQL. This last notion does not exist in PostgreSQL.
It is possible to emulate autonomous transactions through a dblink, but it is a particularly counter-efficient solution that consumes resources.</description></item><item><title>Oracle's packages</title><link>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/oracles-packages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dalibo.github.io/from-oracle-to-postgresql/oracles-packages/</guid><description>Oracle&amp;rsquo;s packages # Proprietary packages have few or no equivalents in PostgreSQL.
